# Random Password Generator
Python program that generates a random password based on your preferences of the password with a seed function that allows you to generate the same password once again in case you didn't copy it or forgot it.
Only uses the random function and built-in Python modules

# Disclaimer
I do not guarantee that theses passwords are 100% safe, I just created the project to test my skills and I do not recommend using the passwords that are generated!
