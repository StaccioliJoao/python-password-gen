# Random Password Generator
Python program that generates a random password based on your preferences of the password with a seed function that allows you to generate the same password once again in case you didn't copy it or forgot it.

All passwords that are displayed have been ran through the https://haveibeenpwned.com API to make sure the generated password was not leaked in the past.

# Required libraries:
* requests: `pip install requests`

# Disclaimer
I do not guarantee that theses passwords are 100% safe, I just created the project to test my skills.
